# NetKit
### Network Securities Research and Experimentation Utility

### This utility has been written solely for educational purposes. Use of this tool for malicious activities is strictly forbidden.

This tool is built to operate on Linux and Windows, but should work on any \*nix system that supports POSIX and raw Berkeley sockets. [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) is required for usage on Windows due to the removal of userspace raw sockets.

## Building
### \*nix
> `gcc Main.c -o NetKit`
### Windows
> Build NetKit.sln from either the command line or Visual Studio.
